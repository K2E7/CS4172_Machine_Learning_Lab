# CS4172_Machine_Learning - IIESTS

## Description
Welcome to the CS4172_Machine_Learning repository! Here, you will find a comprehensive collection of code, statements, and reports for all of my machine learning assignments during my college journey. As a dedicated student passionate about machine learning, I have diligently organized and documented my progress throughout various CS4172 Machine Learning courses and projects.

## Repository Structure
1. **Code:** This directory houses all the code implementations for the CS4172 machine learning assignments. It includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and any other programming languages utilized during the projects. Each assignment is organized in a separate subfolder for easy navigation.

2. **Statements:** In this directory, you will find the original problem statements provided by the professors or course instructors. These statements outline the specific requirements, datasets, and evaluation metrics for each assignment.

3. **Reports:** The "Reports" directory contains detailed documentation of my approaches, methodologies, experiments, and results for each CS4172 assignment. The reports are written in Markdown or LaTeX format, supplemented with charts, graphs, and diagrams to present the findings effectively.

4. **Data:** For transparency and reproducibility, this folder contains the datasets used in the CS4172 assignments. In case any data preprocessing or specific data transformations were applied, those details will be mentioned in the respective assignment's report.

## Why This Repository?
The primary purpose of creating this repository is to showcase my progress and proficiency in machine learning during my CS4172 Machine Learning course. It also serves as an opportunity for others to learn from and collaborate with me on these assignments. Whether you are a fellow CS4172 student seeking inspiration or a potential employer interested in assessing my skills, this repository provides a comprehensive overview of my machine learning journey in the CS4172 course.
